# Real Time Face-Mask Detection Model

## Tech / Framework Used
1. OpenCV
2. Keras
3. Caffe based Face Detection Model

## Features

The Model is trained with above 3000 images of people with and without mask
Hence providing a very high accuracy in its predictions

This system can therefore be used in real-time applications which require face-mask detection for safety purposes due to the outbreak of Sars-Cov-2. This project can be integrated with embedded systems for application in airports, railway stations, offices, schools, and public places to ensure that public safety guidelines are followed.
